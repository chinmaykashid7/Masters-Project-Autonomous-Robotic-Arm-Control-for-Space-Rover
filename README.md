# Autonomous 6-DoF Robotic Arm Control on a Space Rover

**Inverse Kinematics + Vision-Based Feedback + ROS2 Integration**

A complete end-to-end framework that fuses analytical inverse kinematics (IK) with ArUco-marker computer vision to drive a 6-DoF robotic arm on a mobile rover. Designed for extraterrestrial and industrial tasks, this system achieves **sub-millimeter accuracy**, **sub-100 ms latency**, and **fully autonomous closed-loop operation**.

---

## Project Overview

This repository implements a **vision-guided robotic control pipeline** for a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) robotic arm mounted on a rover. It integrates:

* **Analytical inverse kinematics solver** (closed-form DH + geometric methods)
* **Vision subsystem** using OpenCV ArUco markers for 6-DoF pose feedback
* **Real-time GUI** (Matplotlib + PyQt5) for visualization and testing

Together, these modules enable the robotic arm to detect targets, estimate pose, compute joint angles, and actuate in real-time with high precision.

## Motivation & Objectives

### Why this matters

* üöÄ **Space robotics**: Autonomous arms are essential for lunar/planetary rovers where human input is limited.
* üè≠ **Industrial automation**: Vision-guided arms adapt to unstructured environments without manual reprogramming.

### Project Objectives

1. Build a closed-form IK model for a custom 6-DoF robotic arm.
2. Calibrate a camera for distortion-free, accurate 3D perception.
3. Implement ArUco-based detection and pose estimation with `cv2.solvePnP`.
4. Develop a real-time visualization and feedback loop.
